<U>Description</U>: We developed a [ShinyApp Dashboard](https://shiny.rstudio.com) in R to show wildfire statistics and trends within [groundwater dependent ecosystems (GDEs)](https://www.fs.usda.gov/managing-land/natural-resources/geology/groundwater/groundwater-dependent-ecosystems) in California. The final product is a single operating platform where you can click on any groundwater dependent ecosystem in California and view wildfire statistics for that particular ecosystem.
