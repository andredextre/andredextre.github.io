# Qu√© tal!

My name is Andre, I am a Master's student studying Environmental Data Science at the [Bren School of Environmental Science & Management](https://bren.ucsb.edu/masters-programs/master-environmental-data-science) at UC Santa Barbara. My passion is focused on **water resource management and policy**, and my goal is to use data science as a tool to contribute to the solution of the world's water crisis.
